                        I am an aspiring software developer currently living in the greater Philadelphia area.  My programming background has primarily been in C/C++ with some exposure to Python and Rust.  Most of the time I work on my own, so I look forward to more collaborative opportunities via Thinkful.  But perhaps more interestingly, I have two wonderful dogs that are far more entertaining than me.  Just look at these buddies!

                                        This project started off as a toy 3d graphics engine using Vulkan, but quickly evolved into an Svg authoring application.  The goals is to build the application from scratch &hyphen; platform presentation and input layers, application UI, file importing and exporting, etc.  Currently, there are a number of external libraries in use, simply to bootstrap the initial stages of development; however, they will all be replaced.  Currently only three libraries are utilized:

                                        Thus far only two types of files have been imported TrueType/OpenType font files and basic path based Svg files.

                                        Inspried by the many classic turn-based RPGs that have come before, this project hopes to capture their spirit and help bring such concepts forward into the modern era.  With elements of a rhythm game, player will amass a party of characters that offer a variety of skills and abilities that enable a large number of playstyles.  Each combat option has a timing/rhythm component that allows for a higher sense of partisipation in an otherwise passive turn based format.
